# Neo4j Movie Agent

This project is a chatbot application built using Streamlit, OpenAI's language models, and Neo4j for graph-based data storage and retrieval. The chatbot can handle user inputs, generate responses using a language model, and provide context-aware answers by querying a Neo4j Movie database.
